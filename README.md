# ExcelPractice

- In Filter Start excel file, I explore 5 scenarios with Filter function.(I used Google sheet to work on this file as I do not have access to filter function with my Microsoft Excel licence)
  - Filter records based on Country value.
  - Filter record based on Country and/or Industry value.
  - a. Print headers with Filter records, b. Print selected columns header with Filter records.
  - Apply arithmatic functions on filter.
  - Filter column values for a part of string.

- In Data Transformation Practice Sheet, I have worked on the following questions:
  - Enter the provided sales data into the Excel sheet: Uploaded data in the existing sheet using Power Query
  - Format headers as bold and change the font size to 12.
  - Format sales numbers as currency.
  - Sort the data by sales amount in descending order.
  - Filter the data to show only sales from the North region: If converting data into tabular form, a slicer can be created for the region else normal filter can be applied on the region field
  - Calculate total sales using the SUM formula.
  - Calculate average sales using the AVERAGE formula.
  - Create a column chart to visualize the sales data.
  - Apply conditional formatting to highlight sales above 200.
  - Use the IF function to calculate a bonus for sales above 200.
  - Find the sales for a specific product using the VLOOKUP function
  - Find the sales for a particular product using the HLOOKUP function
  - Create a pivot table to summarize sales data by region.
  - Perform a spell check on the document.
  - Create a line chart to visualize the sales trend over time.
  
- In the Data Cleaning Start file, I have completed the following cleaning tasks using Excel:
  
  - Format the table to AutoFit Row Height and Column Width
  - Removed extra text from the Clients column using the Replace feature from the Find & Select tool.
  - Converted all text in the Client column to lowercase using the LOWER() function.
  - Corrected Contact column text values using TRIM() and PROPER() function
  - Created a Region column from the Department column using the Text to Columns feature in the Data tab.
  - Removed duplicate records from the table using the Remove Duplicate feature from the Data tab.
  - Replaced Null values with NA for all columns
  - Added IFERROR() in the Profit Margin column to replace all error messages with NA.

- In the Data Cleaning part 2 file, I have used power query to load and transform sales data and followed the steps mentioned below:
  - Removed duplicate values from the Order ID column
  - Changed the Date field type from the whole number to the Date type
  - Merged First Name and Last Name column to form a single column with full name
  - Round Up the Units to form a whole number
  - Corrected the format of the Salesperson name using the Trim and Capitalized Each Word feature under the Transform tab
  - Generated descriptive statistics using the Data Analysis feature under the Data tab.
  - Created a Pivot table to show the total revenue for each salesperson and added data bars using condition formatting in the revenue column.
  - Created a Pivot table to show revenue and number of unit products bought by each Gender.
  - Created a scatter plot to show the relationship between age and revenue to uncover the potential relationship between the two.

- To handle missing data:
  - Omission: Exclude observation with missing values. This method is better when sufficient data remains after deletion
  - Mean: Good for normally distributed data without outliers.
  - Median: Better for skewed data or data with outliers.
  - Mode: Useful for categorical data or when you want to fill in with the most common value.
